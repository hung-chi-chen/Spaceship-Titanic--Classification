Project Name: Spaceship Titanic Rescue Mission
Description
This project is a data analysis of the Spaceship Titanic's computer system records in order to help rescue crews retrieve the lost passengers who were transported to an alternate dimension due to a spacetime anomaly. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict which passengers were affected by the anomaly based on various features such as age, gender, and ticket class.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a fictional dataset created for the purpose of this challenge. It includes information on almost 13,000 passengers who were aboard the Spaceship Titanic. The dataset contains 10 columns describing various attributes of the passengers such as their age, gender, and ticket class, as well as a target variable indicating whether or not the passenger was affected by the spacetime anomaly.

Tools and Libraries
The project was built using Python and the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Results
After preprocessing the data, performing feature engineering, and tuning various machine learning models, a Random Forest Classifier was selected as the final model. The model achieved an accuracy of 85.2% on the test set, indicating good predictive performance.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict which passengers on the Spaceship Titanic were affected by the spacetime anomaly based on various features. The final model achieved good performance and can be used to help rescue crews retrieve the lost passengers.
